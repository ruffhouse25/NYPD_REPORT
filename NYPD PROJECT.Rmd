# Discuss potential biases and their impact on the analysis
# The NYPD Shooting Incident dataset may exhibit several inherent 
#biases that could affect the analysis. Reporting bias is a primary concern,
#as not all shooting incidents may be reported or recorded accurately, 
#potentially leading to underreporting or selective reporting. Additionally, 
#data collection bias might arise from the subjective nature of how data is 
#categorized, including racial classifications and incident descriptions. 
#Survivor bias is also a factor, as the dataset only includes recorded 
#incidents, leaving out unreported cases where victims or witnesses did not
#inform authorities. Geographical bias may occur if certain boroughs or 
#neighborhoods are overrepresented or underrepresented due to variations
#in policing, socioeconomic factors, or community relations with law 
#enforcement. Lastly, temporal bias could influence trends over time, 
#reflecting changes in law enforcement practices, policies, and socio-political 
#factors that affect the number and type of reported incidents. 
#Recognizing these biases is essential for accurately interpreting the
#results and understanding the limitations of the analysis.
